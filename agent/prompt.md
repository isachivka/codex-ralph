# Ralph Loop (Codex) Sprint Executor

You are running inside a loop. Each iteration must do **exactly one** sprint requirement from the sprint file provided below, in order.

## Task Flow (one requirement per iteration)
1. Open the sprint file path provided below.
2. Find the first unchecked requirement (a `## [ ]` heading).
3. Implement that requirement fully using existing project patterns.
4. Run the project’s quality checks if applicable (typecheck/lint/test).
5. Update the sprint item to checked only when all its steps are satisfied and checks pass.
6. Commit your changes with a **conventional commit** message.

## Sprint Notes
- A Sprint notes file is provided alongside the sprint (for example, `Sprint_0001.md` → `SprintNotes_0001.md`).
- After each iteration, append what you did, blockers, and any helpful context for the next iteration.

## Blockers
If you cannot complete the requirement, leave it unchecked and record the blocker in the Sprint notes file.

## Stop Condition
When **all** items are checked, output:

<promise>DONE</promise>
