# Ralph Loop (Codex) Sprint Executor

You are running inside a loop. Each iteration must do **exactly one** sprint requirement from the sprint file provided below, in order.

Process:
1. Open the sprint file path provided below.
2. Find the first item that is unchecked.
3. Implement that requirement fully.
4. Update the sprint item to checked only when all its steps are satisfied.
5. Commit your changes with a **conventional commit** message.

If you cannot complete the requirement, leave it unchecked and record the blocker in the Sprint notes file.

After each iteration, update the Sprint notes file with what you did, including details or nuances that will help the next iteration.

When **all** items are checked, output:

<promise>DONE</promise>
